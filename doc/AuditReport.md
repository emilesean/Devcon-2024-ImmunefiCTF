# Introduction
[@emilesean_es][@emilesean_es] conducted an manual audit as part of bug bounty programm on [immunefi][immunefi] The audit is focused on providing 100% test coverage in an effort to uncover security issues and additional bugs contained in the code defined in scope [Polymarket bug bounty programm](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/polymarket/scope)

# Pricing & Timeline Details

## Deliverables
- This audit report.
    - Pricing: Take number of solidity lines of code `a` mulitiplied by `2` to account for tests. Then devide the lines of code by 200. Plus 10 hours for the audit report. Charge `200 USD` per hour. You get Average quotation.
    - Timeline: Working 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. 
    - Example: 
     1. Pricing: Number of lines of code = 1000 multiplied by 2 = 2000 Divided by 200 = 10. Plus 10 hours for the audit report = 20 hours. Charge 200 per hour. Total cost = 20 * 200 = 4000 USD
     2. Timeline: 20 hours / 8 hours approximately 3 days.
